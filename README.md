# nasm-mode

`nasm-mode` is a major mode for editing [NASM][nasm] x86 assembly
programs. It includes syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, and
imenu integration. Unlike Emacs' generic `asm-mode`, it understands
NASM-specific syntax. Requires Emacs 24.3 or higher.

The instruction and keyword lists are from NASM 2.11.08.
